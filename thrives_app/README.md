# THRIVES

**T**apping · **H**RV · **R**espiration · **I**sochronic · **V**agal · **E**MDR · **S**olfeggio

A privacy-first, open source nervous system regulation platform for Android and web.  
Built from lived experience. For everyone who is still here.

## What it is

THRIVES is a trauma regulation toolkit — not a wellness startup, not a data business.  
It exists because the person building it needed it, and couldn't find anything that respected their privacy.

**No data collected. No ads. No accounts required. No gamification. Free forever.**

## Privacy

```
Zero analytics. Zero crash reporting. Zero network requests from the core app.
No Firebase. No Google Analytics. No third-party SDKs that phone home.
```

Everything lives on your device. We cannot hand over data we do not hold.  
This is verifiable — the source is here.

Works without Google Play Services (GrapheneOS, CalyxOS, SailfishOS compatible).

## Tech stack

- **Flutter 3.27** — Android + PWA from a single codebase
- **just_audio** — audio playback and tone generation
- **shared_preferences** — local storage for preferences and history
- **vibration** — tactile bilateral stimulation

## Building

```bash
# Install Flutter 3.27+
# https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

# Clone
git clone https://github.com/Is0cre/THRIVE.git
cd THRIVE

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run (connected device or emulator)
flutter run

# Build Android APK
flutter build apk --release

# Build web (PWA)
flutter build web --no-web-resources-cdn
```

---

## Adding nature sounds

Nature sounds are loaded from `assets/audio/nature/`. The app looks for:

```
assets/audio/nature/rain.mp3
assets/audio/nature/ocean.mp3
assets/audio/nature/forest.mp3
assets/audio/nature/river.mp3
assets/audio/nature/thunder.mp3
assets/audio/nature/wind.mp3
```

Good sources for Creative Commons audio:
- [freesound.org](https://freesound.org) — filter by CC0 licence
- [soundsnap.com](https://soundsnap.com)

After adding files, declare them in `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/audio/
    - assets/audio/nature/
```

---

## PWA deployment (self-hosted / Proxmox)

```bash
flutter build web --no-web-resources-cdn

# Serve the build/web/ directory with any static file server
# nginx example: set root to build/web/
# Recommended: add a strict Content-Security-Policy header
```

The PWA installs on iPhone via Safari → Share → Add to Home Screen.
