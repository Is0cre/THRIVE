## Onboarding Questionnaire

Shown once on first launch. Generates a personal starting profile.

### Questions:

1. **What brings you here?**
   - Sleep difficulties
   - Anxiety and stress
   - Trauma processing
   - General nervous system regulation
   - Curiosity / personal growth
   - Multiple of the above

2. **How familiar are you with these tools?**
   - Complete beginner
   - Some experience with meditation or breathing
   - Familiar with EMDR or somatic therapy
   - Experienced practitioner

3. **Do you have a smartwatch or fitness tracker?**
   - Yes (select: Apple Watch / WearOS / Garmin / Fitbit / Polar / Other)
   - No, I'll use phone camera
   - No biofeedback for now

4. **How do you prefer to work?**
   - Guide me, I'll follow suggestions
   - Give me the tools, I'll explore
   - Mix of both

5. **Sensitivity check:**
   - Flashing or moving visuals — comfortable / sometimes difficult / avoid
   - Audio stimulation — comfortable / prefer low intensity / headphones only
   - Vibration — comfortable / avoid

6. **Safety screen:**
   - Are you currently working with a therapist? (Yes / No / Not currently)
   - Are you in acute crisis right now? (Yes → routes to Regulate immediately with crisis resources)

### Output:
Generates a suggested starting category and tool set. Displayed as:

> *"Based on your responses, we suggest starting in Regulate to build your foundation. Processing tools are ready when you are — there's no rush."*

Profile is editable any time in settings.

---

## Adaptive Intelligence

- App learns which tools the user actually opens and uses
- Suggests combinations based on biofeedback patterns
- Notices time patterns — frequently opened at 2am → suggests sleep protocol
- After 2 weeks, offers personalised *"your toolkit"* based on usage
- Never pushy — suggestions are gentle, dismissible, never repeated immediately

---

## UI/UX Design Principles

- **Dark mode default** — important for trauma users, night use, PTSD light sensitivity
- **Minimal and calm** — nothing clinical, cold, or corporate
- **Colour palette** — deep navy, soft teal, warm amber accents, muted not neon
- **Typography** — clean, readable, generous spacing
- **No notifications by default** — user explicitly opts in to any alerts
- **No streaks** — no guilt mechanics whatsoever
- **No onboarding account** — straight to questionnaire, straight to tools
- **Emergency grounding button** — always accessible from any screen, one tap
- **Crisis resources** — available in settings and via distress button, never intrusive

---

## Safety & Disclaimers

- First launch disclaimer — wellness tool, not therapy replacement
- Recommendation to use with professional support where possible
- Distress button on every screen — routes to Regulate + shows local crisis line
- Questionnaire safety screen routes acute crisis users to immediate grounding
- No clinical claims anywhere in UI or marketing
- No diagnosis, no AI assessment of mental state

---

## Privacy & Security — Hardened

### Absolute rules — no exceptions:
- **Zero analytics** — no Firebase, no Google Analytics, no Crashlytics, no Sentry, nothing
- **Zero third party SDKs that phone home** — every dependency audited before inclusion
- **Zero network requests from core app** — verified by network monitoring in CI/CD pipeline
- **No Google Play Services dependency** — app must function fully without Google Play Services installed (important for de-Googled Android like GrapheneOS, CalyxOS)
- **F-Droid compatible build** — no proprietary blobs, listed on F-Droid for users who avoid Google Play entirely
- **No crash reporting that leaves device** — crashes logged locally only, user can optionally export anonymised report manually
- **No advertising ID access** — explicitly opt out in AndroidManifest
- **No READ_CONTACTS, no location, no unnecessary permissions** — minimal permission manifest, every permission justified

### Data encryption:
- All user data AES-256 encrypted at rest
- Journal entries encrypted with user-derived key (not app-generated)
- Biofeedback session data encrypted locally
- Encryption keys never leave the device
- No key escrow — if user loses key, data is unrecoverable (by design)

### Network hardening:
- **Certificate pinning** for any optional cloud sync connections
- **No CDN dependencies** for core functionality — no Google Fonts, no external JS
- **Content Security Policy** hardened on PWA build
- All PWA assets served from user's own Proxmox — no third party hosting
- Optional cloud sync uses **end-to-end encryption** — server (even user's own) sees only encrypted blobs

### Anti-surveillance build practices:
- **Reproducible builds** — anyone can verify the compiled APK matches the source code
- **No proprietary analytics replaced with open source alternatives** — just nothing at all
- **Dependency audit** — all Flutter packages reviewed for hidden telemetry before inclusion
- **No ML Kit or Google AI APIs** — any on-device intelligence uses open models only
- **Health Connect data** — read only what is needed per session, never stored beyond session unless user explicitly saves

### For de-Googled Android users:
- Full functionality without Google Play Services
- APK available direct from GitHub releases
- F-Droid repository maintained
- Health data via open alternatives where possible (e.g. Gadgetbridge for wearables)

### PWA hardening:
- **No Google Fonts** — fonts bundled locally
- **No external scripts** — everything self-hosted
- **No tracking pixels**
- **Strict Content Security Policy** header
- **No cookies** except essential session (and only if user logs into optional sync)
- Passes **Blacklight privacy inspection**

### Legal:
- **No data broker agreements** — ever
- **No government backdoors** — open source ensures this is verifiable
- **GDPR compliant by architecture** — can't violate what you don't collect
- **Privacy policy written in plain language** — no legal obfuscation
- Explicit statement: *"We cannot provide your data to third parties, law enforcement, or intelligence agencies because we do not have it. Your data lives on your device."*

### The one sentence version:
**Big tech, advertisers, insurance companies, employers, and intelligence agencies get nothing. By design. Verifiably.**

## Notes for Claude Code

- Use **just_audio** Flutter package for all audio (supports background play, low latency)
- Use **flutter_animate** for breathing visual pacers and bilateral dot animation
- Use **health** Flutter package for Health Connect / wearable integration
- Use **camera** package for PPG heart rate via camera
- Use **flutter_secure_storage** for encrypted local data
- Use **hive** or **isar** for local database
- PWA: ensure Flutter web build includes correct manifest.json and service worker for offline use
- Test bilateral stimulation timing precision carefully — timing matters clinically
- Audio must continue when screen locks (background audio mode)
- All animations must respect system reduce-motion accessibility setting
